# Certificate authority for testing

This directory contains scripts to create a test CA and sign
CSRs using this CA. These scripts make no attempt to encrypt
the private keys of the CA, and the root and intermediate certificate
both exist in the same directory. Obviously this should not be used
as a production certificate authority, but is for testing purposes.

TL;dr: Creating a CA and signing a CSR can be done with two commands:

./generate-ca.sh
./intermediate-sign.sh /path/to/my.csr

# Setting up the test CA

1. Edit the vars.sh file to set the name of the CA if desired
2. Run the generate-ca.sh command to create a new root certificate
and signed intermediate certificate for this CA.

At this point the CA has been created and relevant files are stores
in the keys directory.

# Signing a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

Save the CSR in PEM format.

Run the sigining command:

intermediate-sign.sh /path/to/my.csr

This will save the signed certificate, and a file called fullchain.pem,
in a newly-created tmp directory. Take the fullchain.pem file and
upload it to the certificate manager web interface.
